Answer
(a) Colonisation affected people's freedom, and nationalist 
sentiments surged during the process of struggle against 
imperial domination. The sense of oppression and exploitation 
became a common bond for people from different walks of life, 
and this resulted in the growth of nationalist ideals. Thus, 
growth of nationalism in the colonies is linked to anti-colonial 
movements

Answer
(a) Colonisation affected people's freedom, and nationalist 
sentiments surged during the process of struggle against 
imperial domination. The sense of oppression and exploitation 
became a common bond for people from different walks of life, 
and this resulted in the growth of nationalist ideals. Thus, 
growth of nationalism in the colonies is linked to anti-colonial 
movements.

<p>
(b) During the First World War, the British army conducted 
forced recruitment from rural areas in India. To finance the 
defence expenditure, high custom duties and income taxes were 
imposed. Also, during 1918-19 and 1920-21, crops failed in 
many parts of India, thereby resulting in acute food shortages. 
All this caused extensive anger and opposition against the British 
colonial rule, and the national movement of India headed 
towards a stronger, more definitive direction.
(c) The Rowlatt Act was passed hurriedly through the Imperial 
Legislative Council despite opposition from Indian members. It 
gave the government autocratic powers to repress political 
activities besides allowing it to detain political prisoners without 
a trial, for two years. The Indian were outraged by this act as it 
was clearly undemocratic and oppressive, and hurt national 
sentiments and dignity.
</p> 
<p>
(d) Gandhiji decided to withdraw the Non-Cooperation 
Movement due to various incidents of violence perpetrated by 
the masses, especially the Chauri Chaura incident in 1922 where 
the people clashed with the police, setting a police-station on 
fire. Gandhiji felt that the people were not yet ready for a mass 
struggle, and that satyagrahis needed to be properly trained for 
non-violent demonstrations.
2. What is meant by the idea Satyagraha?
 
Answer Satyagraha was a novel method of mass agitation. The 
idea of Satyagraha emphasized upon the power of truth and the 
need to search for truth. It suggested that if the cause was true 
and if the struggle was against injustice, then physical force was 
not necessary to fight the oppressor. 
Through non-violent methods a Satyagraha could appeal the 
conscience of the oppressor by the power of truth, which was 
bound to win.

3. Write a newspaper report on:
(a) The Jallianwala Bagh massacre
(b) The Simon Commission
Answer
a) On 13th April 1919, a large crowd gathered in the enclosed 
ground of Jallianwala Bagh – some to protest against the British 
government’s repressive measures, others to attend the annual 
Baishakhi Fair. These people were unaware of the imposition of 
Marshal Law in the city. General Dyer, the Commander, blocked 
the exit points from the Bagh and opened fire upon the innocent 
citizens. Dyer’s intention was to produce a ‘moral effect’ and 
terrorize satyagrahis. Hundreds of innocent people including 
women and children were killed and wounded due to this 
indiscriminate firing by the British soldiers, which ultimately led 
to nation-wide outrage. Jallianwala Bagh incident was the most 
brutal incident in the History of India.
b) The Simon Commission was constituted by the Tory 
Government in Britain, under Sir John Simon. The objective of 
the Commission was to look into the functioning of the 
constitutional system in India and suggest some constitutional 
changes. But nationalists in India opposed the Commission 
because it had not a single Indian member. Therefore, when the 
Simon Commission arrived in India in 1928, it was greeted with 
 
</p> 
the slogan “Go Back Simon”. All parties, including Congress and 
the Muslim league, participated in the demonstrations.
4. Compare the images of Bharat Mata in this chapter with the 
image of Germania in Chapter 1.
Answer
<p> 
 
→ The image of Germania was the symbol of German nation 
whereas; the image of Bharat Mata was the symbol of Indian 
nation.
→ Both images inspired nationalists who worked very hard to 
unify their respective countries and to attain a liberal nation.
→ The image of Bharat Mata is different from that of Germania 
in the sense that former reflects the religious basis of its making.
→ The image of Bharat Mata painted by Abanindranath Tagore 
is bestowed with learning, food, clothing and some ascetic 
quality also. Another painting of Bharat Mata in which we find 
Mata holding Trishul and standing beside a lion and an elephant 
– symbols of power and authority. This image appears to be 
more akin to the image of Germania where she holds a sword 
and a shield.

Discuss
 
1. List all the different social groups which joined the NonCooperation Movement of 1921. Then choose any three and 
write about their hopes and struggles to show why they joined 
the movement.
Answer The different social groups that joined the NonCooperation Movement of 1921 were the urban middle class 
comprising lawyers, teachers and headmasters, students, 
peasants, tribals and workers.
 
 
→ The middle class joined the movement because the boycott 
of foreign goods would make the sale of their textiles and 
handlooms go up.
→ The peasants took part in the movement because they hoped 
they would be saved from the oppressive landlords, high taxes 
taken by the colonial government.
→ Plantation workers took part in the agitation hoping they 
would get the right to move freely in and outside the plantations 
and get land in their own villages.
2. Discuss the Salt March to make clear why it was an effective 
symbol of resistance against colonialism.
Answer The Salt March was an effective symbol of resistance 
against colonialism because it was done in revolt against a 
commodity- salt, used by the rich and the poor alike. The tax on 
salt, and the government monopoly over its production was a 
severely oppressive administrative move. The Salt March was 
effective also because Gandhiji met a large number of 
commoners during the march and he taught them the true 
meaning of swaraj and non-violence. By peacefully defying a law 
and making salt against government orders, Gandhiji set forth 
an example to the whole nation of how the oppressor could be 
confronted in a non-violent manner. This also led to the Civil 
Disobedience Movement in 1930.

4. Why did political leaders differ sharply over the question of 
 
 
separate electorates?
Answer Political leaders differed sharply over the question of 
separate electorates because of differences in opinion. While 
those supporting the cause of minorities and the dalits believed 
that only political empowerment would resolve their social 
backwardness, others like Gandhiji thought that separate 
electorates would further slow down the process of their 
integration into society. Also, it was feared that the system of 
separate electorates would gradually divide the country into 
numerous fragments because every community or class would 
then ask for separate representations
